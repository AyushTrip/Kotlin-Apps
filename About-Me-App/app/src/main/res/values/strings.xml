        \n\nThe stuff here is purposely spaced so that I can test the ScrollView.
        \n\nThis is also a way for me to test spacing in the emulator. Can I talk more this is the third
        \n\ntime that I have to create more newlines so that it can actually do something
        \n\nfor me to actually test it out. \n\n
        \n\nThis is pretty useless ngl.
        \n\nOK we are almost done I just need a few more lines.
        \n\nAre we done yet? OK nice to meet you. Good bye.\n\n
